# Algorithms In JavaScript

**This repo contains example implementations of well known algorithms written in JavaScript.** Compiling such a repository in JavaScript presents some challenges, for while the algorithms themselves are generally stable, the language in which they are expressed is far from it.

For that reason, I have attempted to express these algorithms in forms that are simple enough to be grasped cognitively in the distinct JS idioms. ES3, ES5, ES6, and Typescript.
